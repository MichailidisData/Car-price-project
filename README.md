## üìù Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the price of used cars using various regression models. The project involves:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the relationships between features.
- **Data Preprocessing** to clean and prepare the data for modeling.
- **Modeling** using a variety of machine learning algorithms.
- **Evaluation** to assess the performance of each model using metrics like R¬≤ and MAE.
  
In this project various models were tested, including:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Lasso Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **XGBoost Regressor**

üìå Hyperparameter tuning was also performed using RandomizedSearchCV to optimize the models for better performance.

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset used in this project is called `used_cars.csv`, which contains several features about used cars. These features include:
- Brand & Model: Identify the brand or company name along with the specific model of each vehicle.
- Model Year: Discover the manufacturing year of the vehicles, crucial for assessing depreciation and technology advancements.
- Mileage: Obtain the mileage of each vehicle, a key indicator of wear and tear and potential maintenance requirements.
- Fuel Type: Learn about the type of fuel the vehicles run on, whether it's gasoline, diesel, electric, or hybrid.
- Engine Type: Understand the engine specifications, shedding light on performance and efficiency.
- Transmission: Determine the transmission type, whether automatic, manual, or another variant.
- Exterior & Interior Colors: Explore the aesthetic aspects of the vehicles, including exterior and interior color options.
- Accident History: Discover whether a vehicle has a prior history of accidents or damage, crucial for informed decision-making.
- Clean Title: Evaluate the availability of a clean title, which can impact the vehicle's resale value and legal status.
- Price: Access the listed prices for each vehicle, aiding in price comparison and budgeting.

The dataset can be found in https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/taeefnajib/used-car-price-prediction-dataset/data and is used to train and test the models.

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Models

In this project, we tested several machine learning models to predict car prices. The models used are:

1. **Linear Regression**: A simple linear model used for predicting a target variable (price) based on linear relationships between the features.
2. **Lasso Regression**: A type of linear regression that uses L1 regularization to help reduce overfitting and select important features.
3. **Random Forest Regressor**: A tree-based ensemble method that can model complex non-linear relationships.
4. **XGBoost Regressor**: A gradient boosting method known for its high performance in many regression tasks.

## üìà Results

The models' performance was evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **R¬≤ Score**

Results were compared between the different models to choose the best one for predicting car prices. The XGBoost Regressor provided the best performance after hyperparameter tuning.
Best Parameters:  {'xgb__subsample': 0.7, 'xgb__reg_lambda': 1.5, 'xgb__reg_alpha': 0, 'xgb__n_estimators': 300, 'xgb__min_child_weight': 1, 'xgb__max_depth': 6, 'xgb__learning_rate': 0.1, 'xgb__gamma': 0.3, 'xgb__colsample_bytree': 0.8}

The models were evaluated based on the following metrics:

| Model                     | R¬≤ Score | MAE (Mean Absolute Error) | MSE (Mean Squared Error) | RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) |
